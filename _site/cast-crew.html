    <h2>Glenn Pakulak</h2>
    <div class="scroll">
    <p>Plays 'Jack Franco', an ex-quarterback in middle-age, whose best days
      were spent in the Silverdome playing for the USFL’s Michigan Panthers.
      Franco leaves his suburban life and family behind to go to the only
      place he ever felt whole.
      <br /><br />
      Pakulak was a natural fit for the role and drew deeply from his time as
      a First Team All-American punter at the University of Kentucky (after
      coming in as a walk-on) before playing with several NFL franchises
      including the New Orleans Saints, Washington Redskins and Oakland Raiders.
      Pakulak had been living and acting in Los Angeles before relocating to
      Detroit to begin pre-production on Silverdome.</p>

      <p id="regnerBio" style="display: none"><strong>Producer - </strong>Having grown up a mere 5 miles from the Pontiac Silverdome, some of Chris' earliest memories from his youth are things like his brother taking him to watch Billy Sims mesmerize the crowd and Barry Sanders slip tackle after tackle on the Silverdome turf.  Long drawn to the moving-image, Chris spent several years in Hollywood working on sets of music videos, commercials and movies alongside stars like Steve Guttenberg, John Laroquette, and Jonah Hill.
