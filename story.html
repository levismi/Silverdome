      <p>The Pontiac Silverdome – the most iconic location for football and entertainment in Michigan and once the largest indoor stadium in the entire world.  Home of the Detroit Lions, Detroit Pistons, Super Bowl XVI, Wrestlemania III, the 1994 World Cup, along with concerts by Led Zeppelin & The Who, and even a Mass with Pope John Paul II...and now a feature-length film that tells the story of the downward spiral of a fictional quarterback from the USFL Panthers – the only team to ever win a championship in the Silverdome.</p>
